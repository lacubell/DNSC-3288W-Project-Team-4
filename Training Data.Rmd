df <- read.csv('/Users/daviddimolfetta/Downloads/train.csv')
head(df,10)
str(df)
```


Building the training data linear model:

```{r}
df1 <- df %>% select(SalePrice,LotArea,OverallQual,X1stFlrSF,X2ndFlrSF,OverallCond,LotFrontage,GarageArea)
df1
summary(lm(SalePrice~LotArea+OverallQual+X1stFlrSF+X2ndFlrSF+OverallCond+LotFrontage+GarageArea,data=df1)) 
```
